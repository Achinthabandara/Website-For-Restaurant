# Website-For-Restaurant
My first website project for a university assignment â€” a beautifully designed restaurant website showcasing the rich and flavorful cuisine of Sri Lanka. Built with HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript, this site highlights a menu of traditional Sri Lankan dishes, vibrant food imagery, and a simple, user-friendly layout.
